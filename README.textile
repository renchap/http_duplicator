h1. HTTP Duplicator

h2. Goal

Be able to duplicate an HTTP query to two or more servers.

* If the query succeed on all servers, return HTTP 200, with a list of the servers.
* If the query fails on one or more servers, return HTTP 50X (504 if a timeout, or 503 if another error). The body of the request should contain a list the servers and the HTTP code returned, encoded in JSON
